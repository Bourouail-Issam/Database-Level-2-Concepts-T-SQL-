# Database – Level 2 (Concepts & T-SQL)

Advanced SQL logic, control flow, and performance thinking for real systems.

This level focuses on **treating SQL as a real programming language**, not just queries.  
You will build safe, reusable, and performance-aware database logic used in real-world systems.

---

## 📖 What You Will Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

### 🔹 Write Procedural Logic in T-SQL
- Variables
- IF / ELSE
- CASE statements
- WHILE loops
- Control blocks (BEGIN…END)

---

### 🔹 Handle Errors and Safety Correctly
- TRY…CATCH
- THROW and built-in error functions
- @@ERROR and @@ROWCOUNT

---

### 🔹 Control Data Consistency
- Transactions (BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK)
- Real-world banking-style scenarios

---

### 🔹 Work with Temporary Data
- Table variables
- Temporary tables
- When and why to use each one

---

### 🔹 Build Reusable Database Logic
- Stored Procedures (CRUD patterns)
- Scalar Functions
- Table-Valued Functions:
  - Inline TVFs
  - Multi-statement TVFs

---

### 🔹 Use Advanced Querying Features
- Window Functions:
  - ROW_NUMBER
  - RANK
  - DENSE_RANK
  - LAG / LEAD
- Paging with OFFSET / FETCH
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Recursive CTEs

---

### 🔹 Implement Database Automation
- Triggers:
  - AFTER
  - INSTEAD OF
- Inserted & Deleted pseudo tables

---

### 🔹 Understand Security and Safety
- Dynamic SQL
- SQL Injection risks
- Safer patterns and best practices

---

### 🔹 Begin Performance-Aware Thinking
- Indexing basics
- Execution plans
- Query optimization concepts
